# portal1bringusmenu
Mod Menu for Portal 1 for the Nintendo Switch

Instructions for installation:

1. Dump your game's romfs data using NXDumpTool
2. Copy the 'game.zip' that you dumped to your PC
3. Extract 'game.zip' to a new folder on your PC
4. Open the Bringus Menu .zip archive and copy the contents of its 'nxcontent' folder into the 'nxcontent' folder of your extracted 'game.zip' folder
5. Use 7zip to create a new .zip archive from the extracted 'game.zip' folders. The root of the new 'game.zip' that you just made should show four folders (hl2, portal, nxcontent, platform), not one
6. Copy your newly made 'game.zip' file to '\atmosphere\contents\01007BB017812000\romfs\' on your SD card. If those folders dont exist, make them
